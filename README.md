Diabetes Prediction Web App
A web-based diabetes prediction system using machine learning algorithms and Streamlit.
Overview
This repository contains a diabetes prediction system that uses various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on their medical characteristics. The system is deployed as a web app using Streamlit.
Features
